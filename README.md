## Description
Horiseon page features a large hero banner followed by three main sections and a sidebar.  The page is bookended with a navigational header and a footer.  Semantic HTML and image alt attributes employed to increase Search Engine Optimization.

## Client 
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Task

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code </br>

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning </br>

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes </br>

Heading attributes fall in sequential order </br>

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title. </br>

## Description
**Q. What was your motivation <br />**
A. _Our client 'Horiseon' is a SEO management company, we have been tasked to provide a codebase that follows accessibilty standards. </br>_  

**Q. Why did you build this project? <br />**
A. _As a new front-end development company, we are growing our business and looking for new opportunities. We hope our client is happy with our work and be able to help 'Horiseon' in the future. </br>_

**Q. What problems did you solve? <br />**
<br>A. _When looking at the Horiseon website for the first time, you may think that it is quite sleek and clean. However, when we looked at the HTML and CSS, we discovered that the coding was far from ideal. We have done a complete clean up of the code to make it more acessible, with the mindset of 'to leave it better than what we found it. <br />_
**<br> We have solved:<br />**
1. Semantics HTML 
2. HTML now follow a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning. 
3. All images and icon elements contain accessible 'alt' attributes.
4. All headings fall in sequential order
5. All title elements now contain a concice, descriptive title. 

**Q. What did you learn? <br />**
A. _This was a difficult challenge as I felt unprepared when first provided with the briefing. Several times, I found myself deleting all the code and starting again. I have learnt a lot about semantics and how to implelement them effectively.</br>_
